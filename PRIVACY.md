# Privacy Policy  
**GENEXUS-AI**

Last updated: 2026

## 1. Introduction
GENEXUS-AI is an open-source project that acts as an API gateway providing unified access to third-party AI models, such as those offered by Pollinations.ai.

We respect user privacy by design. Therefore:

**GENEXUS-AI does not collect, store, or process any personal or technical user data.**

## 2. No Data Collection
GENEXUS-AI:
- Does not collect IP addresses
- Does not store API requests or responses
- Does not use cookies
- Does not perform analytics or tracking
- Does not maintain usage logs

All requests sent to the API are forwarded directly to external AI providers and returned to the user without being retained.

## 3. Third-Party Services
GENEXUS-AI relies on third-party services (e.g., Pollinations.ai) to generate content.

Any data processed by those services is subject to **their own privacy policies**, not this one.

## 4. User Responsibility
Users are responsible for:
- The content they submit to external AI models
- Reviewing and complying with the privacy policies of third-party providers

## 5. Changes to This Policy
If this Privacy Policy changes in the future, updates will be clearly documented in the repository.
